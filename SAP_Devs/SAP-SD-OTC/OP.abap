WRITE : 'Order Promising is a critical component of SAP's supply chain and order fulfilment processes. Also known as Available-to-Promise (ATP) or Advanced ATP (aATP), it ensures that customer orders are confirmed with delivery dates that are both feasible and aligned with real-time product availability, capacity, and business priorities. It is the process of evaluating material availability and making realistic delivery commitments during order entry. ATP/aATP checks material stock, incoming receipts, and constraints (e.g., production or transport capacity).It is tightly integrated with sales, production, procurement, and logistics.'.
